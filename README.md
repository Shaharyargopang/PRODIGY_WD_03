I've created a tic-tac-toe web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML structures the game board, CSS styles it, and JavaScript handles user clicks, game state tracking, and winning conditions. This results in an interactive game where users can play against each other or against an AI opponent, aiming to get three markers in a row to win.
